Status: work in progress.

Plan:
	- hopefully some basic funcionality to plan submission and feedback by
	  2011-09-30
	- if going ahead, more complete functionality to be developed Q4 2011

Progress:
    - supports initial import of organisation definitions of courses & assessments.

Known issues:
    - renamed to block 'feedbackmgr' - need to rename github repository
    - level not imported (could act as orgcoursegrp)
	- can't link to categories or courses
	- feedback not defined or supported 

Note:
	needs to be initialised with curriculum-related information; currently there is
	only an application which will extract suitable information from the University of 
	Nottingham's "Saturn" student records system - see
